# Assignment-2-CNN-over-SVHN
Second Assignment in 'Practical topics in Machine Learning' course by Dr. Kfir Bar at Bar-Ilan University.

In this assignment I built a convolutional network (CNN) and trained it over the SVHN data, which is a collection of 3X32X32 images, classified into 10 digits.

I trained the model once on CPU and once on GPU and compared the training time and the accuracy on both training set and test set.
